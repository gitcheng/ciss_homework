Problem 01
A Lambertian wall (width = a, height = b) with radiance L is at a right
angle with the black floor (width = a, depth = c). What is the surface
irradiance at the center of the floor (a/2, c/2)? Neglect all other 
surrounds.


Problem 02
Given a monitor with the following corresponding chromaticity pairs:

phosphor     r      g      b         x       y       z
  red        1      0      0        0.61    0.36    0.03
  green      0      1      0        0.28    0.60    0.20
  blue       0      0      1        0.18    0.09    0.73
  white     1/3    1/3    1/3       0.3027  0.3281  0.3692

Determine the spectral sensitivity functions of the camera whose raw RGB
can be sent to this monitor without color correction.


Problem 03
How to reformulat the color matching experiments from the method of 
adjustment to the method of two alternative forced choice? What is the
trade-off?


Problem 04
Determine the OTF of a lens with an annulus aperture function (outer 
radius R and inner radius r) and a focal length of f.


Problem 05
In the CIE XYZ system, (X), (Y), (Z) are the primaries. We know that these
three primaries are not physically realizable because they fall ouside 
of the spectral locus. Let us pretend that we can have negative power in 
the spectral light. Can you synthesize three spectra that can be used as 
the (X), (Y), and (Z) primaries in the color matching experiment? Note that
the solutions are not unique. So any answer is fine.


Problem 06
For the application of edge sharpening, design a working color space that
can keep the color of the sharpened image look similar to the input image.


Problem 07
IEEE CPIQ standards recommended the acutance as a measure of image
sharpness, using the system MTF weighted by the human contrast sensitivity.
What do you think are the deficiencies of this standard?


Problem 08
In digital color image processing, it is very important to preserve the
color ratios so that the colors are not distorted in the final 
reproduction. However, in the ISP, there is a 3x3 color correction matrix.
Color ratios are changed after the 3x3 matrix. Is there something wrong
here?


Problem 09
How do we generate points uniformly at random on the surface of a sphere 
in a high dimensional space?

Problem 10
For the hypothetical eye below, calculate the retina distance d_r and d_a 
so that the retinal images will be in focus for objects at infinity and at
25 cm.

surface         n       radius(relaxed) distance    radius(accomm.) distance
cornea(front)   1.376   7.700           0.000       7.700           0.000
cornea(back)    1.336   6.800           0.500       6.800           0.550
lens(front)     1.406   10.00           3.600       5.330           3.200
lens(back)      1.336   -5.760          7.200       -5.330          7.700
retina                                  d_r=?                       d_a=?
